# Advent of Code 2016 in Go

This repository contains code submissions in Go (golang) for Advent of Code 2016

http://adventofcode.com/2016

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

## Installing Go
See https://golang.org/

For an interactive tour of go, visit https://tour.golang.org

As for an IDE, I use the golang plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA.
Your favorite text editor may have a go plug-in:
