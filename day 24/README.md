# Advent of Code 2016 in Go
Day 24: Air Duct Spelunking

http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/24

Very similar set-up to day 17. Part 1 takes about 660 ms, part 2: 1.3 secs on my machine.

## Installing Go
To install Go, see https://golang.org/

For an interactive tour of go's syntax and features, visit https://tour.golang.org

As for an IDE, I use the go plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA (also available for the free Community edition).
Your favorite text editor may have a plug-in:
