Calculation for part 1 is too fast to measure with the track function, for part 2 it takes about 155 ms on my machine.

## Installing Go
To install Go, see https://golang.org/

For an interactive tour of go's syntax and features, visit https://tour.golang.org

As for an IDE, I use the go plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA (also available for the free Community edition).
Your favorite text editor may have a plug-in:
