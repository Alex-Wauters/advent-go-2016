# Day 9 of Advent of Code 2016 in Go
Day 10: Balance Bots
http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/10

Modelled each bot as a separate goroutine, waiting for commands and receiving values.

## Installing Go
See https://golang.org/

For an interactive tour of go, visit https://tour.golang.org

As for an IDE, I use the golang plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA.
Your favorite text editor may have a go plug-in:

##Run From Source
`go run bots.go`
