Part 1 finishes in 107 ms, part 2 takes 30 mins on my machine for `n=3004953`. I've made an alternative implementation without cutting/appending a slice,
but it does not improve the solution significantly.

## Installing Go
To install Go, see https://golang.org/

For an interactive tour of go's syntax and features, visit https://tour.golang.org

As for an IDE, I use the go plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA (also available for the free Community edition).
Your favorite text editor may have a plug-in:
