http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/21


Part 1 and 2 take together (with file read) about 1 ms.

## Installing Go
To install Go, see https://golang.org/

For an interactive tour of go's syntax and features, visit https://tour.golang.org

As for an IDE, I use the go plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA.
Your favorite text editor may have a plug-in:
